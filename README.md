## Technologies
This program was written with C++ using libraries iostream and iomanip as well as namespace std.
## Launch
To launch this project, simply select it from the repository and it should open with a welcome message as well as the first prompt to enter your coins. This project has no minimum system requirements. This project does require user input, so please input what is requested from the prompt as it is stated. This program was also outfitted with a loop allowing it to start over if an incorrect input is detected.
## Inspirations
This project was an introduction to loops and if/then statements for me, and was a ton of fun to mess around with to see what all works and what doesn't work. Essentially, if the user enters an input outside of what is being asked for, the program throws up an error message and returns the program back to the beginning. This is an excellent example of what that hould look like for anyone curious about if/then statements and the return command.
